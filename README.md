# cypress-exerciseXtract

Welcome to my Xtract QA Coding Exercise

You will find in this git repository my Cypress code written by me to complete the tasks given to me.
There are two tasks to be compeleted and I will be attempting both of these tasks.

Task 1:
- Automate the completion of a two-page web form and check that the infromation on the confirmation page matches that previously entered

Task 2 :: Stretch Goal
- Define a test which determines the fields to be tested and input values based on the configuration provided

Each task will be in a different branch respectively named Task 1 and Task 2 and will include both answers to the coding exercise
